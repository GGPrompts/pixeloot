{"id":"pixeloot-8c5","title":"Town visual overhaul: bazaar-style visualizer with tent NPCs and reactive ambient effects","description":"Replace the plain 20x15 walled rectangle town with a living bazaar scene that reacts to audio. Each NPC gets a colored tent/canopy instead of a floating shape. Ambient effects (lanterns, particles, sky glow) pulse with the music via an AnalyserNode tap on ChipPlayer.\n\nThe visual concept is based on the \"Bazaar of the Midnight Sun\" music video renderer from ~/projects/htmlstyleguides/music/visualizer/bazaar-of-the-midnight-sun-video.html — but adapted to work as a generic audio-reactive visualizer (not tied to one song) rendered in PixiJS on the world layer.","design":"## Architecture\n\n### 1. Audio Energy Tap (ChipPlayer change)\nAdd an AnalyserNode to `src/audio/ChipPlayer.ts` between masterGain and destination:\n- `getEnergy(): number` — returns 0-1 based on frequency data (average of low-mid bins)\n- Expose via `src/audio/MusicPlayer.ts` as `musicPlayer.getEnergy()`\n- Tiny change: ~15 lines in ChipPlayer, ~5 in MusicPlayer\n\n### 2. Town Visualizer (`src/map/TownVisualizer.ts` — new file)\nDraws the bazaar scene on the world layer using PixiJS Graphics each frame. Key elements from the Bazaar video to port:\n\n**Sky/Background** (drawn on worldLayer behind tiles):\n- Gradient sky: deep purple top → dusky rose mid → amber horizon\n- Palette: SKY_TOP=[25,12,50], SKY_MID=[60,20,40], SKY_BOT=[200,100,30]\n- Sun at horizon with radial glow, pulsing with audio energy\n- Stars (small dots with twinkle) in upper sky area\n- Heat haze lines near horizon\n\n**NPC Tents/Stalls** (replace plain NPC shapes):\n- 5 colored fabric canopies at NPC positions, matching NPC colors:\n  - Vendor (green 0x44cc44) → green tent canopy\n  - Salvage (orange 0xee8833) → orange tent\n  - Skill Trainer (blue 0x4488ff) → blue tent\n  - Map Device (purple 0xaa44dd) → purple tent\n  - Stash (grey 0xdddddd) → white/grey tent\n- Each tent: two posts + curved canopy (quadraticCurveTo) + counter + goods on counter\n- Canopy stripe pattern for visual interest\n- Keep NPC label text above tent\n\n**Lanterns** (ambient):\n- 10-14 lanterns at varying heights, swinging on ropes\n- Glow radius pulses with audio energy\n- Lantern colors: amber, orange, red, gold\n- Flicker effect on beat pulses\n\n**Particles** (dust/spice motes):\n- ~80-120 small circles drifting upward\n- Speed and density scales with energy\n- Colors from warm palette (amber, orange, gold)\n\n**How energy drives visuals:**\n- `energy \u003e 0.3`: lantern glow radius increases, particles move faster\n- `energy \u003e 0.5`: sun ray alpha increases, subtle amber flash\n- Beat detection (energy spike): lanterns flicker brighter, brief flash overlay\n- Always subtle — town should feel warm and alive, not frantic\n\n### 3. Town Map Changes\n- Expand `TownMap.ts` from 20x15 to ~30x20 tiles to give tents room\n- Place tent positions to match NPC tile offsets (currently: Vendor -5/-2, Salvage -5/+2, Trainer 0/-3, MapDevice +5/-2, Stash +5/+2)\n- May need to widen NPC spacing slightly\n\n### 4. NPC.ts Changes\n- Replace simple shape drawing with tent rendering (or delegate to TownVisualizer)\n- Keep the existing click detection system (checkNPCClick with 40px radius)\n- NPC shape still drawn small on top of tent as the \"merchant\" figure\n- Label stays above\n\n### 5. Integration in Game.ts\n- In the frame update, when `isInTown()`, call `townVisualizer.update(dt, musicPlayer.getEnergy())`\n- TownVisualizer manages its own Graphics objects on worldLayer\n\n## Reference Files\n\n**Source inspiration** (read these first):\n- `~/projects/htmlstyleguides/music/visualizer/bazaar-of-the-midnight-sun-video.html` — full Canvas2D renderer with all drawing functions (drawSky, drawSun, drawStall, drawLantern, drawParticles, drawMerchant, etc.)\n- `~/projects/htmlstyleguides/music/audio-tracker/songs/bazaar-of-the-midnight-sun.json` — song JSON (116 BPM, Nordic Fiddle + Hardingfele + Drone Bass + Frame Drum + Aurora Pad)\n\n**Pixeloot files to modify:**\n- `src/audio/ChipPlayer.ts` — add AnalyserNode, getEnergy()\n- `src/audio/MusicPlayer.ts` — expose getEnergy()\n- `src/map/TownMap.ts` — expand town size, adjust spawn\n- `src/entities/NPC.ts` — tent visuals replacing plain shapes\n- `src/core/TownManager.ts` — init/cleanup TownVisualizer\n- `src/Game.ts` — call TownVisualizer.update() in frame loop when in town\n\n**Key existing patterns:**\n- Town uses `game.worldLayer` for grid/tiles, `game.entityLayer` for NPCs\n- Camera centers on player by offsetting worldLayer/entityLayer/effectLayer\n- hudLayer is screen-space (unaffected by camera)\n- All colors use UITheme.ts constants where applicable\n- NPC click detection uses world coordinates via `screenToWorld()`\n\n## Bazaar Video Key Drawing Functions to Port\n\nFrom the video renderer, these are the main draw functions and their PixiJS equivalents:\n\n1. `drawSky()` → PixiJS Graphics with linear gradient fill\n2. `drawSun()` → Graphics circle + radial gradient (may need a sprite/filter for glow)\n3. `drawStall()` → Graphics paths for posts, quadraticCurveTo for canopy, rects for counter\n4. `drawLantern()` → Graphics circle for body + glow, line for rope, position oscillates with sin()\n5. `drawParticles()` → Small Graphics circles repositioned each frame\n6. `drawStars()` → Tiny Graphics circles with alpha oscillation\n7. `drawHeatHaze()` → Optional, Graphics lines with sin() offset\n\nNote: Canvas2D gradients (createLinearGradient/createRadialGradient) don't have direct PixiJS Graphics equivalents. Options:\n- Use PixiJS FillGradient for linear gradients\n- Use a small generated texture for radial glow effects\n- Or render sky/sun to a separate canvas and use as a Sprite texture","acceptance_criteria":"- Town shows tent canopies at each NPC position with matching colors\n- Ambient lanterns swing and flicker, particles drift\n- All effects react to audio energy from ChipPlayer (brighter/faster when music is louder)\n- Works with any track (town, combat, etc.) — not hardcoded to one song\n- Existing NPC click interaction unchanged\n- No performance regression (maintain 60fps)\n- npm run build passes","notes":"## Retro\n- What worked: Clean separation — TownVisualizer as its own class on worldLayer, tent rendering on entityLayer, energy tap via AnalyserNode inserted between masterGain and destination.

Implement effects in UniqueEffects.ts:\n   - gravity_well_pull: during Meteor telegraph phase, pull enemies 150px toward impact point each frame\n   - thornweave_reflect: when player takes damage, emit 15% damage nova hitting enemies within 96px (0.5s throttle)\n   - phasewalk_invis: after movement skill, grant 1s invisibility (alpha=0, enemies lose aggro)\n   - warden_double_trap: increase trap max from 3 to 6, traps arm instantly (remove 0.5s delay)\n   - conduit_player_arc: Lightning Chain starts from player position, arcs to target, applies Chill on bounces\n   - gambler_random_buff: every 10s cycle, random buff for 5s (+30% dmg OR +30% speed OR +50 armor OR instant skill refresh)\n   - tome_recursion_nova: Frost Nova triggers second smaller nova 1s later (64px radius, 50% damage, prevent infinite recursion)\n   - sentinel_shield: below 50% HP, spawn orbiting shield visual that blocks 1 enemy projectile every 3s\n4. Each needs dedicated state tracking, tick functions, and visual feedback\n5.
